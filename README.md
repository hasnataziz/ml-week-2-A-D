# Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Preparation

This project involves the preprocessing of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes passenger information such as age, fare, cabin, survival status, and more. The goal is to prepare the data for machine learning modeling by handling missing values, removing outliers, converting categorical data to numeric format, and standardizing numerical values.

## Problem Statement

The task is to preprocess the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning modeling. This involves:
- Handling missing values.
- Removing outliers.
- Converting categorical data into numeric format.
- Standardizing numerical values.

## Solution Overview

### Loading and Inspecting the Dataset

1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Inspect the data for missing values, potential errors, and outliers.

### Data Cleaning

1. Handle missing values by filling them with appropriate imputation methods.
2. Create new features if necessary and drop irrelevant columns.
3. Identify and remove outliers.

### Data Transformation

1. Convert categorical data into numeric format using one-hot encoding.
2. Normalize or standardize the numerical values to ensure they are on a similar scale.

## Challenges and Resolutions

1. **Missing Values:**
   - **Challenge:** The 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' columns had missing values.
   - **Resolution:** 
     - Filled missing 'Age' values with the median.
     - Created a new feature 'HasCabin' indicating whether a passenger had a cabin, and dropped the 'Cabin' column.
     - Filled missing 'Embarked' values with the mode.

2. **Outliers:**
   - **Challenge:** The 'Fare' column had outliers that could skew the analysis.
   - **Resolution:** Used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and remove outliers.

3. **Categorical Data:**
   - **Challenge:** Machine learning models require numeric input, but 'Sex' and 'Embarked' are categorical.
   - **Resolution:** Applied one-hot encoding to convert these categorical columns into numeric format.

4. **Normalization:**
   - **Challenge:** Different scales in the numerical data ('Age' and 'Fare') could affect the model performance.
   - **Resolution:** Standardized the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
